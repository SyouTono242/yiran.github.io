# About Me

Hello there, welcome to my page!

I'm Yiran, a PhD student from the [Awadalla Lab](https://pawadallalab.org/), in [Molecular Genetics](https://moleculargenetics.utoronto.ca/), at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). 

I do computational biology. What (I believe) this means is that I write code, build models, and fit those models to biological data, trying to dig insights hidden in the biology. The data that I have worked with include [developmental images of human kidney organoids that are exposed to heavy metal](https://www.deriveresearch.ca/), [observation records of non-native birds in North America](https://academic.oup.com/condor/article-abstract/126/1/duad052/7286365), and pathology slides of ovarian cancer. 

I find nature fascinating, and I think with a bit more help on data analysis and machine learning, we can reveal much more of its secrets much easier.

Outside of school, I read (probably too many) books, listen to musicals (mostly on Spotify because I usually can't afford the tickets), and chill with my two Guinea pigs.
